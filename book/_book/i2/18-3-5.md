* events
  * events builder
    * maintain ids of things it has merged
    * merge event is both deleting one of the items and deciding the winner:
        Winner: item
        Losers: [ID]
        Mutated link ends: ID -> {from, to}
    * Split event:
        Losers: [items]
        Winner: [ID]
        MLE: ID -> {from, to}
* layout
  * The ChartLayoutAndContext now needs to be SelectionContext, LayoutContext, ChartChanges and Chart  al to be Shadow wrapper class. This class will have common edits (add, remove, merge and split) but each of the inner classes will have private accessors, as they all act in different ways.
  * There will be a shared interface between ShadowChart and
* chart dao
  * update ends
    * update chart indices
      *
    * update search index
    * if same id then implement replace chart entity
* indices
  1. add/update oi -> item id (we have)
  2. add/update record id -> item id (we have)
  3. add/update conection id -> connection (we have)
  4. need a mapping from deleted connections -> [connection id] (which we don't currently have as they never merge)
  5. added/update entities -> item id -> chart entity
  6. deleted entities -> [item id]
  * All of the above to be put in a new ShadowChart object

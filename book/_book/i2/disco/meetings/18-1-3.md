# Planning Meeting 2: 3/1/18

Mural - investigative web client

We are going to implement the new data structure first

Krio - used to serialise the data (in the form of a i record) into a container. A container is mapped to

NB. A single container holds the information for a single record group.

What exactly defines a link end? And how do we store them?

It is preferable to have one big metadata instead of multiple different ones.

We need to sort out link ends sooner rather than later

The following is the plan:

1. Data Structure
2. Ingestion + AOD record group command
3. Chart Record Group
4. Commands

then later...
7. Container Structure
8. Link ends
9. Summarisation and merge entity

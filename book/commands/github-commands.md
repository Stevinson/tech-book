# Github

## Notes

* There are two ways of integrating changes from one branch into another in Git. One is merge and the other is rebase.
  * merge. This is a three-way merge between the two latest branch snapshots and the ost common ancestor of the two.
  * rebase.  


* NB. If you fork then clone it will have ME as the push repo, but if you clone directly it will have the ORIGINAL repo as the push repo.

* **Personal access token** can be generated by following [these](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/) instructions. This can be used for two-factor authentication or to access protected content in an organisation that uses SSO.

## Commands

* `hub create` : Creates a remote so git can push to github

* `hub browse` : Open browser at the directory.

* `git remote -v` : Sets the origin remote.

* `git add .` : Add the path.
  * `-A` : all

* `git pull`
  * `-r` or `--rebase`: When true, rebase the current branch on top of the upstream branch after fetching. This means that instead of merging, git finds the base of your branch, finds all of the commits between  that base and HEAD, and re-plays those commits on the HEAD branch you're rebasing onto. Git creates new commits that represent what your changes look like on top of the rebased branch. See [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2715085/rebasing-and-what-does-one-mean-by-rebasing-pushed-commits#28257263) for a good explanation.

* `git clone`
  * `-q`: Operate quietly. Progress is not reported to the standard error stream.

* `git remote`
  * `set-url <origin> <git@github.com:User/UserRepo.git>` : To change the upstream remote of the directory:
  * `add <origin> <https://github.com/Stevinson/tech-book.git>` : To add a remote upon creation of the repo.

* `git branch -u origin edward-stevinson`
  Set the upstream branch tying your local branch to the GHE branch
  * `-u <upstream>`, `--set-upstream-to=<upstream>`

           Set up <branchname>'s tracking information so <upstream> is

           considered <branchname>'s upstream branch. If no <branchname> is

           specified, then it defaults to the current branch.

* Show which upstream branch all the branches of that repo are tracking

```Git
- git branch -vv
```

* This removes untracked files from the working tree. The -f is short for —force and overrides the default functionality that git refuses to delete files or directories. The -x means that the standard ignore rules set by the .gitignore file.

```Git
git clean -fx <file_name>
```

* The -a, short for —all, tells the command to automatically stage files that have been modified and deleted, but new files you have not told Git about are not affected.

```Git
git commit -
```

* This removes the .git file and so stops git tracking changes in the repo.

```Git
rm -rf .git
```



* An ancilliary plumbing command primarily used for manipulation. One common usage is to print the SHA1 hashses given a revision specifier.

```Git
git rev-parse
```

* Reset current HEAD to the specified state. You can think of HEAD as the current branch (when you switch branches, the HEAD revision changes to point to the tip of the new branch).

```Git
git reset upstream/gh-pages

cat .git/HEAD # look at what HEAD is pointing to
```

* To remove untracked files from the working tree use the `clean` command. It does this by recursively removing files that are not under version.
  * `-x` This also removes ignored files.

* To deal with merges:

```
git mergetool
```

* To delete a repo:

```
git push origin --delete <branch-name>
```

## Errors

* When unable to connect when attempting to clone a repo, then run the following commands and restart the terminal.

```
git config --global --unset http.proxy
git config --global --unset https.proxy
```

## Administrative Shares

Administrative shares are hidden **network shares**.

To access them open package explorer and type in the url followed by the disk path, eg. `test.com\c$`.

## Disk Volumes and Partitions

A **volume** or **logical drive** is a single accessible storage area with a single file system, typically resident on a single partition of a hard disk.

A **partition** or **disk slicing** is the creation of one or more regions within a hard disk or secondary storage so that the OD can manage the information in each region separately.

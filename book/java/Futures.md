# Future

## Interface

`Future<V>`

##

Futures are the backbone of asynchronous computing. A Future represents the result of an asynchronous computation. Methods are provided to check if the computation is complete, to wait for its completion, and to retrieve the result of the comutation. The result can only be retrieved when the computation is completed, blocking it until it is ready. Once a computation is completed, the computation can not be cancelled.

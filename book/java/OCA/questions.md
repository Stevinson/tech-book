# Notes from Example Questions

* `NegativeArraySizeException` - Thrown if an application tries to create an array with negative size.

* When using the command line command `javac` you must also place the extension`.java` at the end of the class you want compiled.

* **Composition** is the has-a relationship, which is created by using member variables.

* You cannot use primitive types for collection types.

* An instance variable is a variable declared inside a class but outside a method and are associated with an instance of a class.

* A class variable is another term for a static variable.

* An entry point in Java consists of a `main()` method with a single `String[]` argument, a return type of `void`, and modifiers `public` and `static`. Note that the modifier `final` is optional.

* The only package that is always imported in every Java class is `java.lang`.

* Static methods do not have access to any class instance variables.

* Overloading and overriding occur when the method names are the same but overriding occurs when the parameter lists are the same, whilst overloading occurs when the parameter list is different.

* You are allowed underscores in numeric literals (though not at the beginning or the end).

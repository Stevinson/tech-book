# Jupyter

Jupyter Notebooks are a powerful way to write and iterate on your Python code for data analysis. Rather than writing and re-writing an entire program, you can write lines of code and run them one at a time. Then, if you need to make a change, you can go back and make your edit and rerun the program again, all in the same window.

To add imports to notebooks, open the Anaconda GUI, go to the environments tab, click on the relevant environment, drop-down to uninstalled, search for the import and click apply.

## Commands

* To launch the app on a mac, go to the directory you want as the working directory: `/anaconda3/bin/jupyter_mac.command notebook`

* `shift` + `enter` : runs a cell of code

* `exit`/ `enter` : enter or exit edit mode

* `a`/`b` : add a new cell above or below

* `m` : turn the cell into a markdown cell

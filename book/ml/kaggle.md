# Kaggle Advanced Machine Learning Course

## Competition Format
---

1. Data

2. Model

3. Submission

Traditional competitions only require the predictions as a submission as opposed to the model itself.

4. Evaluation

5. Leaderboard


## Main Models Types
---

1. Linear models

* Particularly good for sparse, high-dimensional data
* Separate objects with a plane
* Examples are linear regrassion and SVMs - just have different loss functions
* Often a point cannot be separated - for examples data points that lie in a ring around another class of points.

2. Tree based methods

* eg. Random forest, GBDT (gradient boost descent)
* Choosing splits and constants and the ways that different trees can be combined leads to variety of different tree models.
* Hard to capture linear dependencies
* Almost all winners use these methods
* These methods split spaces into boxes

3. k-nearest neighbour

* Intuition: closer objects are more likely to have same labels
* Uses a squared distance function

4. Neural Networks

* Good for images, sounds and sequences

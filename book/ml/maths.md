## Jacobian Matrix

A Jacobian Matrix can be defined as a matrix that contains a first-order partial derivative for a vector function. The Jacobian Matrix can be of any form. It can be a rectangular matrix, where the number of rows and columns are not the same, or it can be a square matrix, where the number of rows and columns are equal.

## Orthogonal Matrix

The case when the transpose of a matrix is equal to it's inverse. It means that it does not lead to vanishing gradient or explosion problems. 

## Simulated Annealing (SA)

SA is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function. For problems where finding an approximate global optimum is more important than finding a precise local optimum, SA may be preferable to something like gradient descent.

# Productionise

A good production environment can answer all of these questions:

* How do I log the inputs and outputs of my service?
* How do I monitor if the service is operating normally?
* How do I guarantee my service is secure?
* Can my service handle the anticipated capacity at all times?
* Can I scale the my service if I need to handle more capacity?
* How will I test my service?
* How will I deploy my service?
* Does my service need to be up all the time? What happens if it is down?
* How does my service operate with other systems?
* How performant is my service and how do I measure it?
* How reliable is my service?

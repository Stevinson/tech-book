# Incremental Learning

# Discrimitive vs Generative

In General, a Discriminative model models the decision boundary between the classes. A Generative Model explicitly models the actual distribution of each class. In final both of them is predicting the conditional probability P(Animal | Features). But Both models learn different probabilities.

A Generative Model learns the joint probability distribution p(x,y). It predicts the conditional probability with the help of Bayes Theorem. A Discriminative model learns the conditional probability distribution p(y|x). Both of these models were generally used in supervised learning problems.

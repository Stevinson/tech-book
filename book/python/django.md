# Django

## Initial Setup

* `django-admin startproject <mysite>` : Creates a mysite directory with a manage.py file 

The main components of django are:

1. Models
2. Urls
3. Views
4. Admin

## Running Development Server

* `python manage.py runserver 8080`


## Apps

* `python manage.py startapp <appname>` : Create an app - a web application that does something, as opposed to a project that is a collection of configuration and apps.

### Views

To create a view you need:

1. Put an endpoint in the `views.py`
2. Add the relevant url in the `urls.py`. These list paths()'s which take a route and a view

* To get from an url to a view Django uses something called *URLconfs*. The setting.py file in the main directory points to the urls.py in the main directory which subsequently points to the urls.py file in each of the separate application directories.

* The logic for an endpoint goes in the model.py 

* Angled brackets <> are used to capture dynamic information in urls

* One separates the page design from the implementation of the view by using a template. To achieve this you create a directory called templates in the application directory. The settigsn for these are contained in the TEMPLATES section in settings.py. By default this looks for a directory called templates in each of the app directories. From within the views logic you can access the template by using `django.template.loader` and `loader.get_template(<relative path from template directory>)`.

* To call python code in django templates use the `{\{ }\}` syntax to access variables from the view and the `{\% \%}` with inner percentage sign syntax to call functions.

* urls can be directly accessed in templates with the followiong syntax: `{\% url 'app_name:url_name  \%}`

* **Generic views** abstract common patterns to the point where one often doesn't need to write python code to develop an app. These include `ListView` and `DetailView`.

### Models and Database

The model is essentially the database layout with additional metadata, and is the single source of truth about the database. The classes in the model files relates to the tables in the database.

Off the back of the model file Django not only creates the database schema but also creates a Python database-access API for accessing Question and Choice objects. 

* If not using SQLite then settings such as USER, PASSWORD and HOST must be added.

* There a bunch of applications that are installed as default and they make use of the database tables so `python manage.py migrate` needs to be run before running the server. This looks in the `INSTALLED_APPS` that are defined in `settings.py` and creates any necessary tables. 

* `python manage.py makemigrations polls` creates a migration out of the changes that have been made to the models.

* `python manage.py sqlmigrate <app_name> 0001` returns the SQL that is derived from that migration.

* `python manage.py check` checks for any problems in the the project before making migrations.

* Remember to add `__str__` methods to your models.

## API

* `python manage.py shell` to go into the interative shell. Use this instead of just going to the normal python shell as it also sets the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable which gives Django the python import path to the mysite/settings.py file.

* `Table.objects.all()` returns all the elements in that table.
* `Table.objects.get()` can be used to return specific element(s).

* To create a new element create a new object, obj, and then call `obj.save()`. One can then access its fields directly.


## Admin

* `python manage.py createsuperuser` : creates a user that can log in to the admin site. You then need to enter a username, email and password.

* The admin page can be accessed via /admin/

* One also needs to tell the admin that the certain objects have an admin interface. One does this by editing the admin.py file.


## Tests

* The conventional place for an application's test is in the application's `tests.py` file (though the testing system will find any tests in any file that begins with test)

* Create a subclass of `TestCase` with functions that begin with test.

* `python manage.py test <application>` : runs the tests in the specified app.

* Django provides a test client to simulate interacting with the code at the view level.

##Â Style

* Django looks for static files in a directory called `static` inside the application directory.

## Command Line 

* `python manage.py `

# Jupyter

Jupyter Notebooks are a powerful way to write and iterate on your Python code for data analysis. Rather than writing and re-writing an entire program, you can write lines of code and run them one at a time. Then, if you need to make a change, you can go back and make your edit and rerun the program again, all in the same window.

## Commands

* To launch the app on a mac, go to the directory you want as the working directory: `/anaconda3/bin/jupyter_mac.command notebook`

* `shift` + `enter` : runs a cell of code

* `exit`/ `enter` : enter or lxit edit mode

* `a`/`b` : add a new cell above or below

* `m` : turn the cell into a markdown cell

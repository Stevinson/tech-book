# Programming Design Principles

## SOLID

**Single responsibility principles**

**Open/closed principle** - open for extension, closed for modification.

**Liskov substitution principle** - objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.

**Interface segregation principle** - many client-specific interfaces are preferable to a single multi-purpose inteface.

**Dependency inversion principle** - one should depend on abstractions and not concretions. This is a means of decoupling. High-level modules should be independent of low-level implementation details.


## Inversion of Control (IoC) principle

In software engineering, inversion of control (IoC) is a design principle in which custom-written portions of a computer program receive the flow of control from a generic framework. A software architecture with this design inverts control as compared to traditional **procedural programming**: in traditional programming, the custom code that expresses the purpose of the program calls into reusable libraries to take care of generic tasks, but with inversion of control, it is the framework that calls into the custom, or task-specific, code. Inversion of control is used to increase modularity of the program and make it extensible.

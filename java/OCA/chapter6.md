# Chapter 6 - Exceptions

* **Runtime exceptions** are also known as unchecked exceptions.

* A **checked exception** includes Exception and all subclasses that do not extend RuntimeException. Checked exceptions tend to be more anticipatedâ€”for example, trying to read a file that doesn't exist. Java has a rule called the **handle or declare rule**. For checked exceptions, Java requires the code to either handle them or declare them in the method signature.
